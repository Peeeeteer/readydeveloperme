Todo:
Make camera control. ( Camera1 ,Camera 2...Closeup, far away from dropdown.)
-> Kinda works but I dont want to allow zoom and panunder ( X )
Create ortohraphic camera and see how character looks ( X )
-> https://threejs.org/examples/#css3d_orthographic


Major:
- Change 1 pose ( )

- Hair change color with wheel ( )
- Change 1 Beard ( X )
-> Make button change 1,2,3 etc... beards ( X )
-> On each change camera "jumps", fix it. ( )
-> Maybe also adding camera "animate" to that position what is being changed? ( )


- Create Upload image and change logo ( X )

- Change grid color on button press ( back and forth ) (  )

- Experiment with adding more interesting lights ( )
-> Button that changes lights ( )

- Try export 1 image. ( )

- Make master json that controls all the above ( )
-> Pose, Beard, Upload?, Color,Face Shape key, Lights 



Minor:
- Understand how to reacrteate this https://codesandbox.io/s/cameracontrols-basic-forked-5sw5mx?file=/src/App.js:3125-3131 
-> Here setLookAt position 1,2,5 and target at 0,3,0 so we have a little more place at the bottom.
