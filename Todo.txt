Todo:
Make camera control. ( Camera1 ,Camera 2...Closeup, far away from dropdown.)
-> Kinda works but I dont want to allow zoom and panunder ( X )
Create ortohraphic camera and see how character looks ( X )
-> https://threejs.org/examples/#css3d_orthographic


Major:
- Change 1 pose ( )
- Change 1 Beard ( X )
- Create Upload image and change logo ( )
- Experiment with adding more interesting lights ( )
-> Button that changes lights ( )
- Try export 1 image. ( )

- Make master json that controls all the above ( )
-> Pose, Beard, Upload?, Color,Face Shape key, Lights 



Minor:
- Understand how to reacrteate this https://codesandbox.io/s/cameracontrols-basic-forked-5sw5mx?file=/src/App.js:3125-3131 
-> Here setLookAt position 1,2,5 and target at 0,3,0 so we have a little more place at the bottom.
