Todo:
Make camera control. ( Camera1 ,Camera 2...Closeup, far away from dropdown.)
-> Kinda works but I dont want to allow zoom and panunder ( X )
Create ortohraphic camera and see how character looks ( )

Test controling shape keys  ( )


Maybe:
Make character rotate on moving not camera around character ( https://gyazo.com/063c83aebc1eb188f86eba32de2f6f20 ) ( )
Scroll exacly to face ( https://gyazo.com/85c427b891d7db604c5b0804eeb77fdf ) ( )
